                <h2>Community Wellness</h2>
                <p>This <a href="https://johnnyferns14.github.io/my-first-project/" target="_blank">project</a> on community wellness was created to showcase my basic HTML & CSS theory into practice. It was the first project created ever since I started learning how to apply the HTML & CSS concepts. It is a plain website with no javascript functionalities.</p><br>
                    
                <p>Only the major links work here which direct to various sections on the page. The contact form does not do anything when submitted.</p><br>

                <p>It is a very basic project which uses only HTML & CSS and it shows their importance with relation to content & design.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p>This <a href="https://johnnyferns14.github.io/javascript-milestone-project-2/" target="_blank">project</a> was attempted in part to showcase my javascript beginner skills. The webpage does have emphasis on HTML & CSS as well since they all go hand in hand.</p><br>
                <p>The 'TRIPS' link directs user to a new webpage which shows the recent fares for major flights to different destinations. All other links direct to different sections of the page.</p><br>

                <p>This project is a bit complex that the first as in it cludes a few concepts of javascript like <em>async-await, fetch & DOM manipulation</em> which was used to bring about additional function to the elements on the page in addition to HTML & CSS.</p>

                <p>This <a href="http://recipe-flask-johnny.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">project</a> includes working with integrating python backend development with frontend HTML, CSS & Javascript. It also introduces the concept of jijna templating.
                </p><br>
                <p>The tools used for this project are Python, MongoDB, Jinja templating along with HTML,CSS & Javascript.</p>
                <p>The framework used was Flask which is quite popular among python developers to create small scale projects. The backend involves adding CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update & Delete) while the frontend involves rendering the content that we get back from the database and displaying it to the user. It also provides user with the ability to add information(recipes) to the database, edit & delete if required.</p><br>
